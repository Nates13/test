#  French School Embassador 

When I was in middle school I was voted upon as being the best oral communicator in my grade. Due to being nominated, my tasks were to go around to other french schools and present speaches to the students and staff members. My principle and I would go through a whole planned speach and then we would receive and award.

This happened in the 8th grade. At the school I was at, that was the oldest grade. That's why I was chosen over anyone from other grades. This happened during a time where being french in Canada was celebrated. Therefore there were many events that were organized during that year in celebration.

What was good about this experience was that I was able to get a lot of experience doing important presentations in front of a large audience. I was able to learn how to read a script by referring to it instead of reading it. As well as looking at audience members and making it seem like I am talking to them. 

My favorite memory from this was when my school hosted the final stop and i presented in front of my larges audience with all the parents and members from school boards. I felt very important at that time and was highly praised for doing so well.

My least favorite part about this is hard to pick because it was such a great event. If I really had to nit pick at something it would probably be the fact that at some schools the stage setup was horrible. This is really picking at the experience but there was nowhere to put your piece of paper and you had to hold your mic. So it gets a little tricky when you are trying to flip through a page and you have a mic in your hand.

I would grade this experience an "A" because of valuable learning experience I got from it and the feeling of importance while going through the whole experience.
