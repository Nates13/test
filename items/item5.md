# Learning How To Play The Trombone 

When I was younger I learned how to play the trombone. This is not exactly the classic musical instrument to learn but it was much more interesting. I was more interested to learn something completely different from the piano and wanted to use different body parts to play an instrument.

I began playing the trombone just by learning how to blow into it. The formation you have to make with your mouth is much different than what people think. So learning the basics was how I started. I then had to learn and match the keys with the tone of the trombone. Basically a bunch of beginner stuff before I could really get into it. Once i began however, I started to pick things up quicker and quicker.

What I like a bout this experience was that it was cool to learn an instrument that no one I knew knew how to play. Honestly, learning a new skill and being able to show others is a really cool feeling because you can teach them what you now know. I also really liked how it looked playing that instrument because it appears as if you are putting in a lot of work and effort but really you are just sliding something around and blowing through your mouth.

My favorite memory was when I first performed with my trombone. I was honestly very nervous and wasn't sure if I had everything mastered. The first performance was pretty rough. But on the bright side other instruments were able to mask my bad notes at times. This was my favorite memory because I was able to look back at the performance minutes after and just kind of laugh. This was my first performance and it was a little rough which made it memorable.

My least favorite experience from this is all the times that I was practicing at home. I felt really bad that I was playing this instrument in my house while my parents were working. It is quite a loud instrument and it projects a lot of sound. This would be my only bad experience with it because other than that I really enjoyed the whole experience.

If I had to grade this experience I would give it a "A-" because the effort was nothing out of the ordinary and the results were quite rewarding.
