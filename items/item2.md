# Learning English

When I first began school I was enrolled in a full french school. I stayed in the french system till the 8th grade and after that decided to move onto english high school. This was when I was faced with the challenge of learning all of these french words in classes like math or science, and be able to understand them well in english to a point where I can follow the class.

So for my entire 8th grade year I was learning all these french words but in english. I had a tutor, had extra homework to do and had to talk about school to my mom in english. 

What was good about this was that I was no bilingual in more than just basic language. At the time, if I wanted to, I could have translated perfectly math problems or scientific definitions. I was also able to continue my studies in a different language without too much of a disadvantage compared to other students.

My favorite memory of it was every Thursday when I would go see my tutor. She was a very nice women understood the way I learned. When she understood how, she would customize her exercises for me to get the best out of the experience. I was very grateful to her and still am to this day because at the time it was quite the stressful time.

What I didn't enjoy about it was the amount of frustration and effort that I had to put into it. I was not a big scholar at the time so getting me to homework at the time was already a big demand. But I understood that I would'nt be successful in high school if I didn't understand the terms so I had to bare down.

If I had to grade this experience I would give it a "B" do to the stress I went through but it was worth it by the end.
