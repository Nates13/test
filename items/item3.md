# 10km Marathon

In the 11th grade I was challenged in my class to run a 10km marathon within 50 minutes with 3 months of training.

I did this one year in high school. I had ran before when I was much younger but I had never ran 10km. The marathon began in north downtown Toronto and ended by the lake.

This experience was a really good one because I was really able to push myself. As an athlete I am constantly looking for challenges, so when the challenge was placed upon me I was ready and had my mind set on the goal. Also while we were training we had different types of runs. We would have terrain runs where we would run in forest paths and run up, down and around obstacles. There was also just regular road training. But i really like the terrain runs because not only were they challenging but were very nice and peaceful to run through. We would see all types of nature, it was a good morning wake up and was a nice breath of fresh air. 

My favorite memory was of course the event that I had been training months for. I had a great run and felt really comfortable and had a goof pase throughout. I was challenged to get under 50mins and my time ended up being 42mins. This was such a great accomplishment and I was very proud that I could not only get under what I was challenged but I was also able to do it by 8mins.

The only thing I'd say I didn't enjoy about this experience was that at the beginning I was usually not much of a morning person and our team meet ups were at 8am. So being able to wake up before then was already challenging but then we had to run as well. But once I was waking up at that time for about a month, I got used to it.

If I had to give this experience a grade it would be an "A" because it is very rewarding to physically see that all your effort had payed off.
