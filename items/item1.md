# First Experience: Carpentry

Throughout 3 summers during my high school I worked as a framer for my uncles company called Lavrisa Carpentry Limited.

Each summer beginning in the summer of 2016 I would work for my uncles framing company that built custom houses around the GTA.

I really enjoyed this job, I was able to pick up a very handy skill. I learned how to use power tools, read tapes, read blue prints and all sorts of other things. The job was a lot of hard labour but it taught me so many things. 

My favorite memory while working there was this one time where I was cutting a a piece of wood and the power saw kicked back on me and mauled my middle and ring finger. This obviously does not sound like a great experience but now that I look back at it, it's quite the memory and I have a scare to remember it by.

I would say the only thing I didn't enjoy about it was the hot days and long hours. When you are working in 30 degree heat for over 8 hours a day, it really starts to wear on you. 

If I had to give this job a lettered grade it would be a "A-" because you learn so many cool things with so little to put up with.
